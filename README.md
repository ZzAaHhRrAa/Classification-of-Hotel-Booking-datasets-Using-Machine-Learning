# Classification-of-Hotel-Booking-datasets-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the booking status (target value) of rooms in a hotel using a dataset consisting of fifteen features. The main objective is to find the best-performing model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and identify the most important features toward predicting the target value.
